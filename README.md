**Objective**
 
  - Demonstrate how matrix operations can efficiently calculate multi-criteria performance scores.

  - Visualize the relationship between vehicle speed and fuel economy across different models.


**Overview**

  - Modeled two vehicle examples using three attributes: engine power, torque, and fuel efficiency.

  - Created a feature matrix **(Matrix A)** where each row represents a different car and each column represents a   
    feature.

  - Built a weight matrix **(Matrix B)** to assign contributions of each feature toward two performance outcomes:

      -Speed Score

      -Economy Score

  - Multiplied **Matrix A** by **Matrix B** to calculate overall Speed and Economy scores for each car.


**Key Outputs**

  - Matrix calculations of vehicle performance scores (Speed and Economy)
    
  - Comparative bar plot visualizing performance metrics




**Packages Used**

  - reshape2 for data reshaping

  - ggplot2 for performance score visualization
